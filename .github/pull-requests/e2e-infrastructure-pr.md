## Description
Established foundational E2E testing infrastructure for the Bacchus POS web client using Playwright. This PR implements the Page Object Model architecture, creates reusable test utilities, and provides a working smoke test suite to verify the infrastructure functionality.

## Changes Made
- [x] Created E2E test directory structure (`e2e-tests/` with subdirectories for pages, tests, utils, fixtures)
- [x] Configured Playwright webServer to auto-start API and Web services before tests
- [x] Implemented comprehensive BasePage class with MudBlazor-specific helper methods
- [x] Created LoginPage page object with PIN-based authentication support
- [x] Built centralized selectors utility based on actual application inspection
- [x] Added basic smoke test suite to verify infrastructure works

## Testing
- [x] Tests pass locally with my changes
- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes
- [x] I have tested this change manually

### Test Environment
- **OS:** Windows 11
- **Browser:** Edge, Chrome (Playwright managed)
- **Node version:** As per project requirements
- **.NET Version:** 9.0

## Screenshots/Demo
The infrastructure successfully:
- Loads the login page ‚úÖ
- Verifies UI elements are present ‚úÖ
- Interacts with the numeric keypad ‚úÖ
- Takes screenshots for debugging ‚úÖ

Example test output:
```
‚úì [edge] ‚Ä∫ should load login page successfully (1.5s)
```

## Additional Notes
### Key Implementation Details:
1. **Real Application Integration** - Selectors were obtained by inspecting the actual running application rather than making assumptions
2. **MudBlazor Support** - Added specialized methods for MudBlazor UI components (`waitForMudBlazorLoad()`, `clickMudButton()`, etc.)
3. **Auto-Service Startup** - Playwright automatically starts both API and Web services, eliminating manual setup
4. **Page Object Model** - Clean separation of concerns with reusable page objects
5. **TypeScript Support** - Full TypeScript implementation for better IDE support and type safety

### Known Limitations:
- The numeric keypad interaction has some timing quirks where initial button clicks may not register - this appears to be related to the application's initialization timing
- Currently only supports Edge and Chrome browsers in the smoke test

### Next Steps:
- Task 2: Implement Test Data Models and Factories
- Task 3: Build complete Page Object Model Architecture
- Task 4: Implement Authentication Test Suite
- Task 5: Cross-Browser and Integration Testing

## Breaking Changes
None - This is a new feature addition that doesn't affect existing functionality.

## Migration Guide
N/A - New feature addition

- Page objects follow best practices with proper encapsulation
- Selectors are maintainable and based on actual UI structure
- The smoke test verifies the infrastructure works without being overly complex
