# Device Control Patterns

Best practices for controlling devices, triggering from Zigbee buttons/remotes, and structuring service calls.

---

## Entity ID vs Device ID

### The Core Problem

`device_id` is a Home Assistant internal identifier that **changes when a device is re-added** (e.g., after Zigbee mesh repair, integration re-setup, or hardware replacement). Automations using `device_id` will break silently.

`entity_id` is user-controllable, stable across device re-adds, and can be renamed for clarity.

### Device Triggers vs State Triggers

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - device_id changes if device is re-added
trigger:
  - platform: device
    device_id: abc123def456
    domain: binary_sensor
    type: motion

# ✅ RIGHT - entity_id is stable and renameable
trigger:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.hallway_motion
    to: "on"
```

### When Device ID is Acceptable

The only cases where `device_id` might be acceptable:

1. **Device-only triggers** - Some devices expose triggers without entities (see Zigbee section)
2. **Temporary automations** - Quick tests you'll delete
3. **UI-created automations** - The UI defaults to device triggers; convert to entity triggers for production

## Service Calls Best Practices

### Use target: Structure

Modern Home Assistant service calls use the `target:` key to specify entities, areas, or devices:

```yaml
action:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
    data:
      brightness_pct: 100
```

### Target Types

| Type | Use case | Persistence |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `entity_id` | Specific entities | ✅ Stable (recommended) |
| `area_id` | All entities in a room | ✅ Stable |
| `device_id` | All entities on a device | ❌ Changes on re-add |

### Multiple Targets

```yaml
# Multiple entities
target:
  entity_id:
    - light.living_room
    - light.kitchen
    - light.bedroom

# Area targeting (all lights in living room)
target:
  area_id: living_room

# Combined (entities + areas)
target:
  entity_id: light.hallway
  area_id:
    - bedroom
    - bathroom
```

### Template in Targets

```yaml
# Dynamic entity selection
target:
  entity_id: "{{ state_attr('sensor.motion_zone', 'light_entity') }}"

# All lights currently on (advanced)
target:
  entity_id: >
    {{ states.light 
       | selectattr('state', 'eq', 'on') 
       | map(attribute='entity_id') 
       | list }}
```

## Zigbee Button/Remote Patterns

### ZHA (Zigbee Home Automation)

ZHA buttons fire `zha_event` events. Use **event triggers** with `device_ieee` (the device's IEEE address), which is **persistent** across re-adds.

```yaml
# ✅ ZHA button trigger - device_ieee is persistent
trigger:
  - trigger: event
    event_type: zha_event
    event_data:
      device_ieee: "00:15:8d:00:07:26:f2:8a"
      command: "toggle"
```

For a complete multi-button remote with trigger_id + choose, see `references/examples.yaml` Example 2.

#### Finding ZHA Event Data

1. Go to **Developer Tools → Events**
2. Subscribe to `zha_event`
3. Press your button
4. Copy the `device_ieee` and `command` values

### Zigbee2MQTT (Z2M)

Z2M creates **MQTT device triggers** that are autodiscovered. These are acceptable because Z2M manages the device-to-trigger mapping.

```yaml
# ✅ Z2M device trigger - autodiscovered
trigger:
  - trigger: device
    device_id: abc123def456  # OK for Z2M, managed by autodiscovery
    domain: mqtt
    type: action
    subtype: single

# Alternative: MQTT topic trigger (more explicit)
trigger:
  - trigger: mqtt
    topic: "zigbee2mqtt/Bedroom Button/action"
    payload: "single"
```

#### Z2M Device Trigger Discovery

1. Open your device in **Settings → Devices**
2. Look for available triggers under "Automations"
3. The UI will show valid trigger types and subtypes

### Z2M vs ZHA Comparison

| Aspect | ZHA | Zigbee2MQTT |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Trigger type | `event` trigger | `device` trigger or `mqtt` trigger |
| Identifier | `device_ieee` (persistent) | `device_id` (autodiscovered) |
| Event name | `zha_event` | MQTT device trigger |
| Button actions | `command` field | `type` and `subtype` |

## Domain-Specific Patterns

### Lights

```yaml
# Turn on with brightness and transition
action:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
    data:
      brightness_pct: 80
      transition: 2
      color_temp_kelvin: 3000

# Turn on multiple lights differently
action:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.main
    data:
      brightness_pct: 100
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.accent
    data:
      brightness_pct: 30
      rgb_color: [255, 147, 41]
```

### Climate

```yaml
# Set temperature with HVAC mode
action:
  - action: climate.set_temperature
    target:
      entity_id: climate.living_room
    data:
      temperature: 22
      hvac_mode: heat

# Set preset mode
action:
  - action: climate.set_preset_mode
    target:
      entity_id: climate.living_room
    data:
      preset_mode: away
```

### Covers (Blinds/Shades)

```yaml
# Set to specific position (0 = closed, 100 = open)
action:
  - action: cover.set_cover_position
    target:
      entity_id: cover.living_room_blinds
    data:
      position: 50

# Tilt control
action:
  - action: cover.set_cover_tilt_position
    target:
      entity_id: cover.living_room_blinds
    data:
      tilt_position: 75
```

### Media Players

```yaml
# Play media
action:
  - action: media_player.play_media
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.living_room_speaker
    data:
      media_content_id: "https://example.com/audio.mp3"
      media_content_type: music

# Set volume (0.0 to 1.0)
action:
  - action: media_player.volume_set
    target:
      entity_id: media_player.living_room_speaker
    data:
      volume_level: 0.5
```

### Notifications

```yaml
# Mobile app notification
action:
  - action: notify.mobile_app_phone
    data:
      title: "Motion Detected"
      message: "Motion in {{ trigger.to_state.attributes.friendly_name }}"
      data:
        tag: "motion-alert"
        actions:
          - action: "DISMISS"
            title: "Dismiss"
          - action: "VIEW_CAMERA"
            title: "View Camera"

# Persistent notification
action:
  - action: notify.persistent_notification
    data:
      title: "Reminder"
      message: "Check the laundry"
      notification_id: "laundry_reminder"
```

---

## Vacuum Control

```yaml
# Start cleaning
action:
  - action: vacuum.start
    target:
      entity_id: vacuum.roborock

# Return to dock
action:
  - action: vacuum.return_to_base
    target:
      entity_id: vacuum.roborock

# Clean specific rooms (integration-specific)
action:
  - action: vacuum.send_command
    target:
      entity_id: vacuum.roborock
    data:
      command: app_segment_clean
      params:
        - 16  # Room ID
        - 17
```

---

## Response Data

Some services return data. Use `response_variable` to capture it:

```yaml
action:
  - action: weather.get_forecasts
    target:
      entity_id: weather.home
    data:
      type: hourly
    response_variable: forecast
  - action: notify.mobile_app_phone
    data:
      message: "Tomorrow's high: {{ forecast['weather.home'].forecast[0].temperature }}°C"
```

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Using entity_id in data instead of target

```yaml
# WRONG (deprecated)
action:
  - action: light.turn_on
    data:
      entity_id: light.living_room
      brightness: 255

# RIGHT
action:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
    data:
      brightness: 255
```

### ❌ Hardcoding device_id for regular devices

```yaml
# WRONG - breaks on device re-add
action:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      device_id: abc123def456

# RIGHT
action:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
```

### ❌ Forgetting service data structure

```yaml
# WRONG - brightness_pct at wrong level
action:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
    brightness_pct: 100

# RIGHT - brightness_pct inside data
action:
  - action: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
    data:
      brightness_pct: 100
```

## Quick Reference: Service Call Structure

```yaml
action:
  - action: domain.service_name   # Required
    target:                       # Optional but recommended
      entity_id: entity.id        # Single or list
      area_id: area_name          # Single or list
      device_id: device_id        # Avoid except for Z2M
    data:                         # Service-specific parameters
      parameter: value
    response_variable: result     # Capture response (if needed)
```

## Quick Reference: Trigger Types for Devices

| Device Type | ZHA | Zigbee2MQTT | Generic |
|-------------|-----|-------------|---------|
| Button/Remote | `event` (zha_event) | `device` or `mqtt` | `state` |
| Motion sensor | `state` | `state` | `state` |
| Door/Window | `state` | `state` | `state` |
| Temperature | `state` or `numeric_state` | `state` or `numeric_state` | `state` or `numeric_state` |
| Switch | `state` | `state` | `state` |

Always prefer `state` triggers with `entity_id` for sensors and switches. Only use event/device triggers for stateless devices (buttons, remotes).
