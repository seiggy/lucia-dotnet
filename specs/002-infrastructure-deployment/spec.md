# Feature Specification: Infrastructure Deployment Utilities and Documentation

**Feature Branch**: `002-infrastructure-deployment`  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We need a collection of infrastructure utilities and documentation for our users, including, but not limited to, the following: Dockerfile for lucia-dotnet app, GitHub Action for building and publishing lucia-dotnet docker container to Docker Hub, sample docker-compose with redis; config keys for Embeddings and Chat model config; and lucia-dotnet app, sample kubernetes chart with lucia-dotnet deployment, service with ingress, redis, and config, documentation on how to deploy the solution to a home kubernetes or docker environment, documentation on how to host the application on a linux server using typical linux hosting daemon, and what configuration is required (redis, embeddings model deployment, and openai compatible llm endpoints)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Docker Container Deployment (Priority: P1)

A self-hosting user wants to run Lucia on their home server using Docker containers with minimal configuration. They need a working Dockerfile and a docker-compose configuration that includes all required dependencies (Redis, embedding models, LLM endpoints).

**Why this priority**: This is the most common deployment scenario for home users and provides the quickest path to a working installation. It's the foundation for all other deployment methods.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `docker-compose up` and verifying that the Lucia application starts, connects to Redis, and responds to health check endpoints. Delivers a working Lucia instance accessible via HTTP.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Docker and Docker Compose are installed on the host, **When** user runs `docker-compose up` with the provided configuration, **Then** all services (Lucia app, Redis) start successfully and the application is accessible on the configured port
2. **Given** the docker-compose file with sample configuration, **When** user provides their OpenAI-compatible API endpoints and embedding model configuration, **Then** the application connects successfully and can process requests
3. **Given** a running Docker container deployment, **When** the container is stopped and restarted, **Then** the application recovers its state from Redis and resumes operation without data loss
4. **Given** the Docker deployment documentation, **When** a new user follows the setup instructions, **Then** they can successfully deploy Lucia in under 15 minutes

### User Story 2 - Kubernetes Cluster Deployment (Priority: P2)

A user with an existing home Kubernetes cluster wants to deploy Lucia as a scalable, production-ready service with proper ingress, persistent storage, and configuration management using Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts.

**Why this priority**: Kubernetes deployments provide better scalability, resilience, and production-readiness for users with existing K8s infrastructure. This is the second most common deployment for advanced users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by applying the Kubernetes manifests/Helm chart to a test cluster and verifying that pods start, services are accessible through ingress, and the application handles pod restarts gracefully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a running Kubernetes cluster, **When** user applies the provided Kubernetes manifests or Helm chart, **Then** all resources (deployment, service, ingress, configmap, secrets) are created successfully
2. **Given** the Kubernetes deployment with ingress configured, **When** user accesses the application through the ingress hostname, **Then** requests are routed correctly to the Lucia pods
3. **Given** a running Kubernetes deployment, **When** a pod is terminated, **Then** Kubernetes automatically restarts the pod and the application continues serving requests without manual intervention
4. **Given** the Kubernetes configuration examples, **When** user needs to update LLM endpoints or Redis connection strings, **Then** they can modify the ConfigMap/Secret and rolling restart the deployment without downtime

---

### User Story 3 - Linux Systemd Service Deployment (Priority: P2)

A user wants to run Lucia directly on a Linux server as a native systemd service without containerization, managing dependencies (Redis, embeddings, LLM endpoints) through traditional Linux package management and service configuration.

**Why this priority**: Some users prefer traditional Linux service management for simplicity, lower overhead, or integration with existing non-containerized infrastructure. This provides an alternative to Docker for users comfortable with systemd.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by installing the application on a fresh Linux VM, configuring the systemd service file, and verifying that the service starts on boot, logs to journald, and can be managed with standard systemctl commands.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Linux server with systemd, **When** user follows the installation documentation and configures the systemd service file, **Then** the Lucia application starts as a background service on system boot
2. **Given** the systemd service is running, **When** user runs `systemctl status lucia`, **Then** the service reports healthy status and logs are accessible via `journalctl -u lucia`
3. **Given** configuration for Redis, embeddings, and LLM endpoints, **When** user updates the application configuration files, **Then** they can restart the service with `systemctl restart lucia` and changes take effect
4. **Given** the Linux deployment documentation, **When** user needs to troubleshoot issues, **Then** they can access structured logs and diagnostic information through standard Linux logging tools

---

### User Story 4 - CI/CD Pipeline for Container Publishing (Priority: P3)

A project maintainer or contributor needs an automated GitHub Actions workflow that builds the Docker container, runs tests, and publishes versioned images to Docker Hub whenever code is pushed to main or a release tag is created.

**Why this priority**: While important for project maintenance, this is lower priority for end users. However, it enables consistent, tested container images and reduces manual release work for maintainers.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering the GitHub Action (via push or manual workflow dispatch), verifying that the container builds successfully, passes tests, and is published to Docker Hub with correct tags.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a GitHub Actions workflow file in the repository, **When** code is pushed to the main branch, **Then** the workflow automatically builds and publishes a Docker image tagged with `latest`
2. **Given** a version tag is created (e.g., `v1.2.3`), **When** the tag is pushed to GitHub, **Then** the workflow builds and publishes a Docker image tagged with the version number
3. **Given** the GitHub Actions workflow, **When** the build or tests fail, **Then** the workflow stops and does not publish a broken image to Docker Hub
4. **Given** the published Docker image on Docker Hub, **When** users pull the image, **Then** they receive a tested, working version of the application with appropriate version metadata

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Redis connection is lost during runtime? (Application should handle reconnection gracefully with retry logic)
- How does the system handle missing or invalid LLM endpoint configuration? (Should fail with clear error messages indicating which configuration is missing or invalid)
- What happens when the Kubernetes ingress controller is not installed? (Documentation should check for prerequisites and provide clear error messages)
- How does the Docker container behave when environment variables are not set? (Should use secure defaults where possible or fail fast with descriptive errors)
- What happens when the systemd service crashes? (systemd should automatically restart the service based on restart policy)
- How does the deployment handle network partitions between Lucia and Redis? (Should implement circuit breaker patterns and graceful degradation)
- What happens when the Docker Hub rate limit is exceeded during image pull? (Documentation should include authentication setup and mirror/cache options)
