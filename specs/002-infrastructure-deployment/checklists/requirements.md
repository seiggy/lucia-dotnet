# Specification Quality Checklist: Infrastructure Deployment Utilities and Documentation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Details**:

### Content Quality - PASSED
- The specification focuses on deployment scenarios and user outcomes without prescribing specific implementation approaches
- Written from the perspective of different user personas (home users, K8s users, Linux admins, maintainers)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASSED
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete and actionable
- All 15 functional requirements are testable with clear deliverables (Dockerfile, docker-compose, K8s manifests, documentation)
- Success criteria are quantifiable (time-based metrics: 15 min, 20 min, 25 min; percentage-based: 95% success rate; rate-based: <1 question per 10 users)
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes (deployment time, success rates) rather than technical implementation
- Each user story includes detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- Edge cases cover common failure scenarios (Redis connection loss, missing config, network partitions)
- Scope is well-bounded across four user stories with clear priorities
- Dependencies explicitly identified in Key Entities section

### Feature Readiness - PASSED
- Each functional requirement maps to testable deliverables (infrastructure files + documentation)
- Four user stories cover the full deployment journey with priorities (P1: Docker, P2: K8s/systemd, P3: CI/CD)
- Success criteria provide clear measurable outcomes for each deployment method
- Specification remains implementation-agnostic while being specific about required capabilities

## Notes

- Specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)
- All acceptance criteria are independently testable
- Clear prioritization enables incremental delivery (P1 → P2 → P3)
- Documentation requirements ensure user success is measurable
