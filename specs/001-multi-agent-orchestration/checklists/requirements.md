# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: âœ… PASSED

The specification successfully migrated from the old framework to speckit format with the following improvements:

1. **User Stories Prioritized**: Four independent user stories with clear P1, P2, P3 priorities
2. **Technology-Agnostic**: All success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes (response times, accuracy, context preservation) rather than implementation details
3. **Complete Requirements**: 15 functional requirements covering routing, execution, persistence, and observability
4. **Edge Cases Identified**: 7 edge cases covering ambiguous requests, failures, concurrency, and persistence
5. **Measurable Success Criteria**: 10 specific, testable outcomes with quantifiable metrics

The spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase to create implementation planning documents.
