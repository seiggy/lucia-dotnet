# Integration Notes

> Created: 2025-10-02

## Link Targets
- `README.md`: Add an **Architecture** section linking to `@.docs/architecture/2025-10-02-lucia-platform-architecture/diagram-index.md`.
- `.docs/product/tech-stack.md`: Reference the container diagram when describing the .NET services and planned data stores.
- `.docs/specs/` (future Conversation or Agent specs): Embed the sequence diagram to explain request choreography.
- `custom_components/lucia/README.md`: Link to the system context for contributor onboarding.

## PR Checklist
- [ ] Add README navigation entry pointing to the diagram index.
- [ ] Cross-link relevant product docs and specs as noted above.
- [ ] Ensure Mermaid previews render correctly in your documentation platform.
- [ ] Re-run Mermaid syntax validation if diagrams are modified (manual check recommended when tooling is unavailable).
- [ ] Confirm the audience and scope remain aligned with the latest roadmap before merging changes.
