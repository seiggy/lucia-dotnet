## Executive Summary

Overall project health: Yellow. Core architectural foundations (Phase 0) are complete. Phase 1 has partially begun with A2A migration largely executed, but Home Assistant custom component implementation (config flow, conversation entity) not yet started. A2A integration tasks lack test coverage and JSON-RPC spec compliance refinements (streaming, task ops). No blocking external dependencies identified, but risk of schedule slippage if Phase 1 Home Assistant work does not commence immediately.

Key wins:
- Successful adoption of official A2A NuGet package (upgraded beyond spec baseline)
- JSON-RPC endpoint scaffolded with message/send handling
- Well-known agent card endpoint added (new this period)

Key gaps:
- Test suite lacks A2A schema and JSON-RPC validation tests
- Home Assistant plugin structure and config flow not implemented
- Version drift between spec docs (0.1.0-preview.2) and actual dependency (0.3.1-preview)

Immediate focus: Establish Home Assistant custom component skeleton and add missing A2A compliance tests before expanding conversation features.

## Project Health Dashboard

| Metric | Current | Target | Trend |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| Completion Rate (spec tasks) | 8% (est) | >80% Phase 1 | Stable | 
| Active Specs | 1 | 1-2 | Stable |
| Blocked Items | 0 | 0 | Stable |
| Velocity (features/week) | Low (foundational) | Moderate | Neutral |

## Current Status

### Active Specification: Home Assistant Conversation Plugin
Status: Early Execution / Partial (Task 1 partially implemented)
Completion (rough): 8% (1 of 12 sub-items meaningfully done + foundational A2A steps outside original version scope)

Progress Detail (Task Group 1 - A2A Migration):
- 1.2 Add NuGet package: DONE (using newer 0.3.1-preview)
- 1.3 Remove custom implementation: DONE
- 1.4 Update API to official AgentCard: DONE
- Added /.well-known/agent.json endpoint (extra beyond task list)
- 1.6 Service registration improved (duplicate transient removed) – PARTIAL (needs validation tests)
- 1.5 JSON-RPC endpoints: PARTIAL (message/send only; streaming & tasks stubbed with errors)
- 1.1, 1.7, 1.8: NOT STARTED (tests & full interface adoption validation missing)

Remaining Work Before Moving to Task Group 2:
- Add JSON-RPC compliance & schema tests
- Implement (or defer with documented rationale) streaming strategy
- Update documentation versions & mark completed subtasks

No progress yet on Tasks 2–7 (Home Assistant component, config flow, Python A2A client, conversation entity, errors/notifications, integration tests & docs).

## Recently Completed (Foundational)
- Phase 0 items (per roadmap) previously completed: registry, orchestration, semantic kernel integration
- Adoption of official A2A package replacing custom protocol code

## Blocked Specifications ⚠️
None currently blocked. Potential future risk: Without test coverage, regressions may go undetected; schedule risk if Python component start slips another week.

## Technical Insights

### Architecture Evolution
- Migration to official A2A reduces maintenance and aligns with external ecosystem; introduces requirement to keep version parity across .NET and Python (currently divergent: .NET 0.3.1-preview, Python 0.2.0).
- JSON-RPC endpoint centralization established; future capability to plug in streaming via SSE or chunked responses.

### API Evolution
- Agent registry remains REST; conversation now centralized under /api/agents/{agentId}/v1 (JSON-RPC). Need formal schema validation layer (middleware or filter) for robustness.

### Quality & Testing
- Gap: No tests validating AgentCard schema / error codes (-32600, -32601, etc.).
- Opportunity: Introduce contract tests + snapshot comparisons for agent card JSON.

### Risks & Technical Debt
- Version Drift: Spec docs outdated vs implemented versions (risk of contributor confusion).
- Incomplete JSON-RPC feature set (streaming, tasks) – risk of client divergence.
- Missing Home Assistant client scaffolding delays end-to-end validation.

### Recommendations
1. Add A2A contract & JSON-RPC negative tests before expanding feature surface.
2. Decide streaming approach (SSE vs incremental JSON) and implement or explicitly defer.
3. Begin Python component scaffold (manifest, __init__, config_flow) immediately after tests.

## Timeline & Progress

Historical (Since Spec Creation ~5 weeks):
- Weeks 1–2: A2A migration planning (docs) – no code
- Weeks 3–4: Package adoption & endpoint scaffold
- Week 5 (current): Added well-known endpoint & service cleanup

Projected Next 3 Weeks:
- Week 6: A2A tests + doc/version alignment
- Week 7: Home Assistant component skeleton + config flow MVP
- Week 8: Python A2A client & conversation entity integration tests

Velocity Projection: If maintained, Phase 1 completion risk extends ~2 weeks beyond original 2-week estimate (total ~4 weeks) unless parallelization increases.

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate (Next 7 Days)
1. Implement A2A test suite (schema + JSON-RPC methods) – unblock reliability.
2. Scaffold Home Assistant custom component directories & manifest.
3. Update spec & tasks with accurate version references and mark completed subtasks.

### Near Term (Next 14–21 Days)
- Implement config flow with agent selection & API key validation.
- Build Python A2A client (registry fetch + message/send JSON-RPC integration).
- Add conversation entity with context ID handling.

### Risk Mitigation
- Add version matrix doc to prevent drift.
- Establish minimal streaming contract early (even if stub) to reduce refactor risk.
- Introduce CI checks for presence of required A2A fields in agent card response.

### B. Technical Debt Register (Current)
| Item | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Missing A2A schema tests | Medium (regression risk) | Add contract tests this week |
| JSON-RPC streaming unimplemented | Medium (future feature needs) | Decide SSE vs chunked; create follow-up task |
| Version inconsistency across docs | Low (confusion) | Update docs & tasks.md |
| No Python component scaffold | High (Phase 1 slip) | Start scaffold immediately after tests |

### C. Recent Decisions Summary
- DEC-001 to DEC-005: Architectural foundations (multi-agent, Semantic Kernel, protocol adoption, integration strategy, coding standards)
- Implicit decision (unrecorded): Upgrading A2A beyond planned 0.1.0-preview.2 to 0.3.1-preview – should be logged.
