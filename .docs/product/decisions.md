## 2025-08-06: Initial Product Architecture

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Build Lucia as a privacy-focused, open-source replacement for Amazon Alexa/Google Home using a multi-agent architecture powered by Microsoft Semantic Kernel, targeting Home Assistant users who want local control with optional cloud LLM support.

### Context

The smart home market is dominated by cloud-dependent voice assistants that compromise user privacy and offer limited customization. Home Assistant has emerged as the leading open-source home automation platform, but lacks sophisticated AI-powered voice control. This creates an opportunity for a privacy-first, locally-hosted assistant that deeply integrates with Home Assistant.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Monolithic Assistant Architecture**
   - Pros: Simpler to implement, single codebase, easier deployment
   - Cons: Less scalable, harder to extend, single point of failure

2. **Node.js/TypeScript Stack**
   - Pros: Same language as Home Assistant frontend, large ecosystem
   - Cons: Less enterprise features, weaker typing, less experience

3. **Python-only Solution**
   - Pros: Native Home Assistant integration, single language
   - Cons: Performance limitations, less suitable for complex agent orchestration

### Rationale

The multi-agent architecture with .NET backend provides enterprise-grade reliability while maintaining extensibility. Semantic Kernel offers state-of-the-art AI orchestration capabilities. The split between Python (Home Assistant plugin) and C#/.NET (agent system) leverages the strengths of each platform.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Scalable architecture supporting distributed deployment
- Strong typing and performance from .NET
- Native Home Assistant integration via Python
- Privacy-first with optional cloud services

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity with two languages
- Steeper learning curve for contributors
- More complex deployment compared to monolithic solutions

## 2025-08-06: Semantic Kernel and MagenticOne Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Adopt Microsoft Semantic Kernel as the core AI framework and implement multi-agent orchestration using the MagenticOne pattern for agent collaboration.

### Context

Building a sophisticated AI assistant requires robust orchestration of LLMs, embeddings, and multi-agent coordination. The framework choice significantly impacts development velocity and system capabilities.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **LangChain**
   - Pros: Popular, extensive documentation, Python and JS versions
   - Cons: Less structured, weaker typing, no native multi-agent support

2. **Custom AI Framework**
   - Pros: Complete control, optimized for use case
   - Cons: Massive development effort, no community support

3. **AutoGen**
   - Pros: Microsoft-backed, good multi-agent support
   - Cons: Python-only, less mature than Semantic Kernel

### Rationale

Semantic Kernel provides enterprise-grade AI orchestration with excellent .NET integration. MagenticOne offers proven patterns for multi-agent collaboration. This combination accelerates development while maintaining flexibility.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid development with proven patterns
- Strong Microsoft support and community
- Excellent integration with Azure and OpenAI
- Type-safe agent development

**Negative:**
- Dependency on Microsoft ecosystem
- Learning curve for Semantic Kernel concepts
- Less community content than LangChain

## 2025-08-06: A2A Protocol for Agent Communication

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement a standardized Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol for inter-agent communication, allowing agents to discover capabilities and collaborate on complex tasks.

### Context

Multi-agent systems require standardized communication protocols to enable collaboration. The protocol must support capability discovery, request routing, and response aggregation.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Direct Method Invocation**
   - Pros: Simple, type-safe, fast
   - Cons: Tight coupling, no distributed deployment

2. **Message Queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka)**
   - Pros: Async, scalable, reliable
   - Cons: Added complexity, infrastructure overhead

3. **gRPC**
   - Pros: Fast, type-safe, bi-directional streaming
   - Cons: More complex than HTTP, harder to debug

### Rationale

HTTP-based A2A protocol provides the right balance of simplicity and capability. It supports distributed deployment, is easy to debug, and allows gradual migration to more sophisticated protocols if needed.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Language-agnostic protocol
- Easy testing and debugging
- Supports distributed deployment
- Progressive enhancement possible

**Negative:**
- HTTP overhead for local communication
- Synchronous by default
- Requires careful API versioning

## 2025-08-06: Home Assistant Integration Strategy

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Development Team

### Decision

Create a Python-based Home Assistant custom component that communicates with the .NET agent system via HTTP API, implementing Home Assistant's LLM and Conversation APIs for seamless integration.

### Context

Home Assistant requires custom components to be written in Python. The integration must feel native to Home Assistant users while leveraging the powerful .NET agent backend.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Direct Python Implementation**
   - Pros: Single codebase, simpler deployment
   - Cons: Limited AI capabilities, performance issues

2. **Home Assistant Add-on Only**
   - Pros: Easier installation, contained environment
   - Cons: Limited to Home Assistant OS, no distributed deployment

3. **External Integration via MQTT**
   - Pros: Loose coupling, standard protocol
   - Cons: Additional infrastructure, latency concerns

### Rationale

A custom component provides the most native experience for Home Assistant users while maintaining architectural flexibility. The HTTP API allows the agent system to run anywhere while appearing as a native Home Assistant integration.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Native Home Assistant experience
- Flexible deployment options
- Clear separation of concerns
- Supports both local and remote agent hosting

**Negative:**
- Requires maintaining Python and C# codebases
- Additional complexity in communication layer
- Potential latency in request handling

## 2025-08-06: Microsoft Coding Standards Adoption

**ID:** DEC-005
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Process
**Stakeholders:** Development Team

### Decision

Follow Microsoft's official C# coding guidelines and enterprise best practices for all .NET development, with consistent application of nullable reference types, async/await patterns, and structured logging.

### Context

Consistent coding standards improve maintainability, reduce bugs, and make the codebase more approachable for contributors familiar with enterprise .NET development.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Custom Style Guide**
   - Pros: Tailored to project needs
   - Cons: Additional documentation burden, learning curve

2. **Community Standards (like Google's)**
   - Pros: Well-documented, widely known
   - Cons: Not idiomatic for .NET development

### Rationale

Microsoft's guidelines are the de facto standard for .NET development. Following them reduces onboarding time for experienced .NET developers and ensures compatibility with tooling.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Familiar patterns for .NET developers
- Excellent tooling support
- Reduced decision fatigue
- Higher code quality

**Negative:**
- May conflict with some modern practices
- Verbose in some cases
- Requires discipline to maintain
